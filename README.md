# ML-Mini-Project
# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project predicts house prices using three machine learning models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, based on the Ames Housing dataset. Each model's performance is evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Directory Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset.
- `notebooks/`: Contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) notebook.
- `src/`: Contains code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `models/`: Stores the trained models.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists dependencies.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage
Run each of the following files in order:

1. Data Preprocessing: `src/preprocess.py`
2. Model Training: `src/train.py`
3. Model Evaluation: `src/evaluate.py`
